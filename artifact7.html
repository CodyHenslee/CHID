				<h2>Indicators: S2.A/E, S2.E, S3.U,S3.E, S4.A/E</h2>
                
<p>This project reflects my effort to assist the ex-Managing Editor of The Pine Bluff Commercial newspaper to develop a Layout Desk Training program that can be utilized for introducing new employees to the processes, styles and standards of the news room and layout desk but also serve as a refresher course for current employees of the newspaper’s newsroom. The course, as it currently stands, is a single module that covers the office’s ‘Style & Continuity’ guidelines but future development will include the addition of ‘Workflow’ and ‘Off-Site Communications’ modules; however, I am currently limited by the availability and cooperation of my SME. This was my first opportunity to work directly within Blackboard LMS and I found it very enlightening to finally be behind the curtain and see how this LMS works.</p>

<p>The objectives for the course were discussed and agreed upon by my SME, the Managing Editor, and myself. We kept an open line of communication to ensure that all questions and concerns were addressed and corrected to ensure alignment between all objectives, materials, activities and assessments (S2.A/E,S4.A/E). The aim of the course, as supported by best practices for instruction, was to effectively educate the learner while also keeping the learning activities, instruction and assessments as close as to the job environment and context as possible. Keeping this in mind, I chose to develop learning activities, learning materials and assessments that would require the learner to complete the instruction within their immediate work environment and through the assistance of the peers they will be expected to work along-side (S3.U,S3.E). All instruction was created and technologies selected with attention placed on accessibility for the anticipated diversity of potential job applicants (S2.E). </p>
<p>Note: To access the course you will need a CourseSites login. Once your login is created, follow the link attached at the top of this page and self-enroll into the course to view its contents.</p>
